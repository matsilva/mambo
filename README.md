## Problem: Integrations Management is Still a Headache

In a world where integrations should be a solved problem—a commodity—teams still find themselves reinventing the wheel. Every company, every project, faces the same dilemma: how to manage integrations effectively without drowning in a sea of complexity and costs.

### What’s Wrong with Current Solutions?

- **Fragmented and Inflexible**: Current platforms only solve half the problem. You’re forced to mix and match different tools for integration and orchestration, resulting in a brittle, hard-to-maintain system that’s cobbled together from various parts.
- **High Costs, Low Satisfaction**: Existing iPaaS solutions promise seamless integrations and orchestration but deliver little. They come with exorbitant fees for overly complex, inflexible, or incomplete solutions that often lack the specific integrations or customization your business needs.
- **Unsexy, Tedious Work**: Let’s be honest—no developer enjoys setting up, managing, and maintaining integrations and data pipelines. It’s tedious, error-prone, and takes away from the work that actually drives business value and innovation.
- **“Close, But No Cigar” Frustration**: You keep finding platforms that look promising, only to discover missing critical features, lack of customization, or pricing models that just don’t fit your needs. The result is always “close, but no cigar.”

### The Result?

Time and money wasted on suboptimal solutions that don’t scale, aren’t flexible, and don’t offer the control you need. Teams are stuck with technical debt and frustration rather than focusing on what truly matters—your core business value.

## Solution: Mambo - The Open-iPaaS for Product-Focused Software Teams

Mambo is here to solve the integrations management problem once and for all. We believe managing integrations should be straightforward, flexible, and transparent. If Mambo 'out of the box' doesn’t quite fit your specific use case, no problem—just fork the project and customize it to suit your needs.

### What Makes Mambo Different?

- **Open and Extensible**: Mambo isn’t a black box. It’s an Open-iPaaS built with easy to develop with tech like TypeScript, Fastify, and OpenTelemetry, allowing full customization over how integrations are managed, secured, and monitored.
- **Unified, User-Friendly Interface**: A sleek, customizable UI that lets you manage integrations in one place. Easy to brand and embed into your own applications, offering both power and simplicity.
- **Enterprise-Ready, Developer-Centric**: Mambo is built with multitenancy, user management, access controls, compliance, and security in mind—giving enterprises everything they need without sacrificing flexibility or control.

### **Open Source and Free to Use**

Mambo is fully open source, providing you with a robust integrations management platform without the high costs or hidden fees of traditional solutions. Deploy it on your own infrastructure, customize it to your needs, and scale on your terms—without the financial burden.

### How Can You Help?

There are two main challenges in making Mambo a truly comprehensive Open-iPaaS: scaling integrations development and managing partnerships with third-party platforms. The best way to help is by contributing to the integrations coverage matrix—building new connectors and refining existing ones.

Equally important is creating and managing partner development programs with these third-party platforms to ensure smooth, reliable integrations. If you have experience or interest in working with platform partners, your contributions can help strengthen Mambo’s ecosystem and expand its capabilities.

Join the community, contribute to integrations, or help establish partnerships—your efforts will make Mambo even more powerful and valuable for everyone.

### Will Mambo Ever Cost Me?

The goal of Mambo is to stay free and open source forever. However, my crystal ball can't predict the future—if there’s enough demand for a managed service and people want to throw money my way, I’d certainly consider it! But as it stands, Mambo is built to be a free tool that you can use, customize, and deploy as you like.
